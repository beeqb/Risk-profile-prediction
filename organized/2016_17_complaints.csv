IFC,CAO,21,2003,Zambia,Konkola Copper Mines Plc (KCM),"Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) is the largest copper producer in Zambia, exporting copper and cobalt cathodes. The KCM Project envisaged a two phase development program that involved purchasing and rehabilitating the mine and its processing facilities. In January 2002, Anglo Gold, the owners of KCM, announced that they were resiling from the project. Consequently, IFC also withdrew from the project during the same month. IFC acknowledged the uncompleted commitments that remained upon exiting the project, yet stressed the considerable environmental and social improvements resulting from the project.   In July 2003, Citizens for a Better Environment, a local civil society organization, lodged a complaint with CAO on behalf of the people of Mingomba & Kawama. The complaint raised issues relating to IFCs responsibilities for an on-going resettlement action plan during and after its exit from the project. The following concerns were raised:   1. IFC exited the project before full implementation of the RAP and failed to put in place mechanisms for monitoring to ensure full implementation of RAP over the post-exit period in accordance with IFC policies and standards;   2. In contrast with its policy on consultation and disclosure, IFC failed to consult on or publicly disclose to affected communities the decision to exit the project, which caused uncertainty and desperation amongst affected communities.   CAO Action Phase 2 of the project involved the construction of a dam that required the neighboring communities of Kawama and Mingomba to be resettled. Accordingly, the resettlement plan was devised, which identified a number of development needs in Kawama and infrastructure needs in Mingomba. The RAP also highlighted the fact that many people in Mingomba were highly dependent for their livelihood on the production of charcoal. As such, the RAP suggested measures to ease the transition to agriculture in order to ensure an environmentally and sustainable livelihood.   Status The Assessment Report, completed in November 2003, found that IFC was under no obligation to remain engaged in the environmental and social performance of KCM after it exited as an investor and shareholder. Nevertheless, IFC did engage with KCM at the time of exit to assist KCM in implementing the RAP until complete. As such, CAO recommended that no further action be undertaken in relation to the complaint. The report highlighted that the long term economic and social well-being of the communities was dependant on the quality of delivery of the agreements made in the RAP, which would require coordination, partnership, patience and creativity. The complaint was closed in January 2005.",116,,Citizens for a Better Environment,,A,Konkola Copper Mines Plc,8570,,,IFC,30000000,$30 million (Equity),"Oil, Gas, Mining, & Chemicals",,Environmental contamination,Closed,1-Jul-03,,,,,1-Jul-03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/case_detail.aspx?id=116懮_囅蕧鲣夆羅葔侏_鰩_鈸束忎_囇聦__暘亼鲻巵輳錆囈聫漘,http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/document-links/links-116.aspx

IFC,CAO,21,2012,South Africa,Lonmin,"praisal In light of the reports of serious violence which resulted in the deaths of Lonmin workers and members of the South African police August 2012, the CAO Vice President triggered a compliance appraisal of IFCs investment in Lonmin plc. In particular how IFC reviewed, interacted and advised its client on matters related to work force, labor conflicts, labor unions, broader social impacts of unattended labor unrest/ latent conflict, and how IFC has assured itself of implementation of relevant IFC policy provisions. A CAO compliance appraisal is a preliminary investigation to determine whether the CAO should proceed to a full compliance investigation of IFC. Through such appraisals, CAO ensures that investigations of IFC/MIGA are initiated only for those cases that may raise substantial concerns regarding environmental and social outcomes.   Project Overview In December 2006 IFC approved an investment and advisory service project to support Lonmins multi-year expansion program at its platinum operations. The project consists of i) the development, expansion, and mechanization of Lonmins South African mines; ii) the financing of planned transactions regarding broader and more equitable ownership of South African businesses through Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) participation in Lonmins development programs; and (iii) through an IFC Advisory Service project, a comprehensive, large-scale community and Local Economic Development Program (LEDP) for the community of about 350,000 people living on and around Lonmins main operations.   CAO Findings CAOs appraisal report considered the adequacy of IFCs appraisal and supervision of its Lonmin investment. In particular it considered how IFC reviewed, interacted with and advised its client on matters related to labor conflict, and how IFC assured itself of implementation of relevant IFC policy provisions. Based on a review of documentation and interviews with IFC staff, the appraisal report raises concerns as to the adequacy of IFCs E&S performance in relation to this investment. It also identifies potentially more systemic issues regarding the way in which the Sustainability Framework was applied to an equity investment in a publically listed company.   Status  Absent a complaint from affected workers, however, CAO finds that the nexus between the E&S performance issues outlined in this appraisal and the tragic outcomes of the August 2012 dispute is insufficiently established. Therefore, CAO decides that an investigation is not warranted and closed the case.

IFC,CAO,21,2015,South Africa,Lonmin,"At the time of the complaint, IFC had an active Category A project with Lonmin Plc, a large platinum producer, for a multi-year expansion program of the companys operations. The project consisted of the development, expansion, and mechanization of Lonmins South African mines; and the development of a comprehensive, large-scale community and local economic development program (LEDP). IFCs investment in the project entailed a standby 10 year A loan of $100 million and an equity investment of $50 million. IFC completed its involvement in the project in January 2016.   In June 2015, CAO received a complaint from a local community organization and community members regarding Lonmins Marikana mine in North West Province, South Africa.  The complaint cites concerns about contamination of air and groundwater, and negative impacts on the living conditions of nearby communities, including on housing, water and sanitation, infrastructure and employment. The complaint also cites concerns about the projects social and environmental commitments, IFCs social and environmental due diligence, and non-compliance with national law.    CAO Action CAO found the complaint eligible for further assessment in June 2015 and an assessment trip was conducted in August 2015. During the assessment, the parties agreed to engage in a CAO convened dispute resolution process. CAO subsequently held a series of bilateral meetings with the parties during 2016 to provide capacity building and information, and assist them in drafting and adopting a set of principles to govern the dispute resolution process. CAO also convened several joint meetings as part of the mediation.  However, in December 2016 the complainants decided to withdraw from the process citing lack of progress, and this decision was confirmed in March 2017.  In accordance with CAOs Operational Guidelines, the case is being transferred to CAO's compliance function for appraisal.   In December 2017, CAO concluded its compliance appraisal. Considering the accounts of adverse impact provided by the complainants and the questions CAO identified in relation to IFCs review and supervision of the projects related aspects, CAO concludes that the complaint meets CAO's criteria for investigation.   Terms of reference for this compliance investigation were disclosed on January 16, 2018. A Xhosa version is available.

A limestone quarrying and crushing operation located in Meghalaya serves the cement plant and the two centres of operations are connected by an overhead belt conveyor. IFC approved an A Loan of $35 million, a B Loan of up to $10 million and equity of $10 million in 1998, and invested in 2003.  In January 2013, a complaint was filed by a number of individuals on the Indian side of the project.  The complaint raises concerns about the legitimacy of the land acquisition and use process for the projects limestone quarrying operation close to the villages of Shella and Tynger in Meghalaya. The complainants further state that as Khasi indigenous people they have been deprived of their land, their livelihood has been impacted, and their customary land rights and systems have not been respected.  The complainants have requested confidentiality.   CAO Action CAO found the complaint eligible for further assessment in January 2014. During the assessment, CAO found no agreement among the key parties to proceed with a dispute resolution process under CAO auspices. Therefore, the complaint was transferred to CAOs Compliance function for appraisal, per CAO Operational Guidelines.   CAO completed its Compliance Appraisal in October 2014.  The Compliance Appraisal notes that the primary concerns of the complainants in this case relate to the companys acquisition of land that they claim to own.  While a just resolution of these issues is no doubt important for the parties, the information available is not found to support a conclusion that they raise substantial concerns about environmental and/or social outcomes of the project. CAO also notes the complainants concerns about the adequacy of IFCs engagement with the projects impacts on the indigenous people.  Absent a complaint from a broader group of project-affected people, however, CAO is reluctant to pursue an investigation on this basis. While Compliance Appraisal raises a number of questions about the strength of IFCs preparation and its supervision of E&S aspects of the project, these are not found to be of sufficient systemic importance to justify an investigation. On the balance of considerations, CAO thus decides to close the case.  Status CAO closed the case on October 14 , 2014. CAO's Appraisal Report and Assessment Report are available under 'View Documents' below.    Status as of October  17, 2014  Note: A CAO assessment does not entail a judgment on the merits of complaints.  Rather, the aim is to listen to people's concerns, understand the different perspectives, and gauge whether it is possible to address the concerns in a collaborative process.",211,,Confidential,,A,Lafarge Surma Cement Limited,8035,,,IFC,,Loans totaling $50 million plus $10 million equity,Manufacturing & Services,,Labor; Project due diligence,Closed,6-Jan-14,,,,,6-Jan-14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/case_detail.aspx?id=211,http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/document-links/links-211.aspx

WB,IP,23,2017,Peru,Boosting Human Capital and Productivity Development Policy Financing with a Deferred Drawdown Option,"The Boosting Human Capital and Productivity Development Policy Financing with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DPF-DDO) aim to support Peru efforts to foster productivity growth under a more challenging external environment. Lower export demand, including from China, worsening terms of trade, and the prospects of higher borrowing costs are affecting a large number of emerging economies. In this context, a larger portion of economic growth in Peru will have to come from further productivity gains. The proposed DPF-DDO supports measures targeting key productivity constraints by enabling the improvement of the quality of human capital, fostering competition pressures, and facilitating trade. Given the Presidential elections in mid-2016, the operation is a stand-alone DPF-DDO. Nevertheless, the reforms supported are the first installment of widely backed medium term reform program the National Competitiveness Plan 2014-18 and the National Education Project to 2021. This DPF-DDO will also help to maintain the dialogue with the next government, facilitating the implementation of the reform agenda. The proposed amount for the DPF-DDO is US$ 1.25 billion. Peru continues to have a sound macroeconomic policy framework. Throughout the period of high growth and unlike many countries, Peru saved the commodities windfall, leaving itself with significant savings to continue to afford needed investments and strong macroeconomic buffers to face more challenging times. Indeed, domestic savings increased from just above 10 percent of GDP in the early 1990s to 24 percent in 2014, with public sector savings playing a key role over the last 10 years. Growth slowed to 2.4 percent in 2014.",121,"​On October 13, 2017, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection related to the Republic of Peru: Boosting Human Capital and Productivity Development Policy Financing (DPF) with a Deferred Drawdown Option. The Panel issued a Notice of Receipt on its website on October 17, 2017. The Request was submitted by the leaders of two local indigenous organizations and their representative, claiming harm caused by Peru’s Law No. 30230, which they allege is supported by the Bank’s Program. The Requesters claim that this law has reduced or eliminated Peru’s capacity to guarantee the territorial rights of indigenous peoples and to provide regulatory oversight of the extractive industry. They specifically point to an increased number of oil spills that they claim have caused damage to forests, health issues, loss of clean water and food, economic and physical displacement, and loss of cultural resources and livelihoods in the affected communities, particularly those of indigenous peoples.","Edwin Montenegro, President of Organización Regional de los Pueblos Indígenas de la Amazonía Peruana (ORPIAN); Jorge Pérez, President of Organización Regional de los Pueblos Indígenas del Oriente (ORPIO); Derecho, Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (DAR)",Individual; Individual; International CSO,N/A,Government of Peru,P156858,Active,,IBRD,,USD 1.25 billion,Community Capacity and Development,11/2/16,Indigenous peoples; Other environmental; Other community health and safety issues; Pollution; Water; Displacement (physical and/or economic); Cultural heritage; Livelihoods,Closed without Output,2017-13-10,2017-13-10,2017-20-11,no,Outside of Mandate; Inadequate link between bank action and harm alleged,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://projects.worldbank.org/P156858?lang=en,http://ewebapps.worldbank.org/apps/ip/Pages/ViewCase.aspx?CaseId=129,http://ewebapps.worldbank.org/apps/ip/PanelCases/121-Request%20for%20Inspection-13%20October%202017.pdf; http://ewebapps.worldbank.org/apps/ip/PanelCases/121-Management%20Clarification%20Note-8%20November%202017.pdf; http://ewebapps.worldbank.org/apps/ip/PanelCases/121-Notice%20of%20Non-Registration-20%20November%202017.pdf

ADB,SPF,25,2017,Sri Lanka,"Green Power Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment Program
Sri Lanka","In recent years Sri Lanka has improved its energy sector and achieved a national electrification ratio of 94% (2012) compared with 29% in 1990. But a longer-term challenge is to reduce its high dependence on expensive fossil fuel energy. The energy sector struggles to (a) meet growing demand for electricity at a low cost and acceptable reliability rates, and (b) attain long term sustainability. The share of thermal energy in the power generation mix has increased from 6% in 1995 to 54% in 2011 that creates a high energy cost base. Demand growth has been met by expensive oil-fired thermal plants. This is not the solution to the country's energy security and environment protection in the long term. Diversification of the generation mix, especially from renewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, and supply and demand side management is the only way to correct this situation.",Jan-17,,Prashan De Silva; Ianthe de Silva,Individual; Individual,,,47037-002,Closed,Technical Assistance,,,"USD 700,000",Energy,,Other environmental; Other community health and safety issues; Biodiversity; Pollution; Water,Closed without Output,2017-31-01,2017-31-01,1/2/17,,,1/2/17,2017-23-02,no,Unknown,,,,,,,,,,,2017-23-02,https://www.adb.org/projects/47037-002/main#project-pds,,https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/page/42458/sri-green-power-dev-complaint-form-31jan2017.pdf

IFC,CAO,21,2003,Zambia,Konkola Copper Mines Plc (KCM),"Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) is the largest copper producer in Zambia, exporting copper and cobalt cathodes. The KCM Project envisaged a two phase development program that involved purchasing and rehabilitating the mine and its processing facilities. In January 2002, Anglo Gold, the owners of KCM, announced that they were resiling from the project. Consequently, IFC also withdrew from the project during the same month. IFC acknowledged the uncompleted commitments that remained upon exiting the project, yet stressed the considerable environmental and social improvements resulting from the project.   In July 2003, Citizens for a Better Environment, a local civil society organization, lodged a complaint with CAO on behalf of the people of Mingomba & Kawama. The complaint raised issues relating to IFCs responsibilities for an on-going resettlement action plan during and after its exit from the project. The following concerns were raised:   1. IFC exited the project before full implementation of the RAP and failed to put in place mechanisms for monitoring to ensure full implementation of RAP over the post-exit period in accordance with IFC policies and standards;   2. In contrast with its policy on consultation and disclosure, IFC failed to consult on or publicly disclose to affected communities the decision to exit the project, which caused uncertainty and desperation amongst affected communities.   CAO Action Phase 2 of the project involved the construction of a dam that required the neighboring communities of Kawama and Mingomba to be resettled. Accordingly, the resettlement plan was devised, which identified a number of development needs in Kawama and infrastructure needs in Mingomba. The RAP also highlighted the fact that many people in Mingomba were highly dependent for their livelihood on the production of charcoal. As such, the RAP suggested measures to ease the transition to agriculture in order to ensure an environmentally and sustainable livelihood.   Status The Assessment Report, completed in November 2003, found that IFC was under no obligation to remain engaged in the environmental and social performance of KCM after it exited as an investor and shareholder. Nevertheless, IFC did engage with KCM at the time of exit to assist KCM in implementing the RAP until complete. As such, CAO recommended that no further action be undertaken in relation to the complaint. The report highlighted that the long term economic and social well-being of the communities was dependant on the quality of delivery of the agreements made in the RAP, which would require coordination, partnership, patience and creativity.

A limestone quarrying and crushing operation located in Meghalaya serves the cement plant and the two centres of operations are connected by an overhead belt conveyor. IFC approved an A Loan of $35 million, a B Loan of up to $10 million and equity of $10 million in 1998, and invested in 2003.  In January 2013, a complaint was filed by a number of individuals on the Indian side of the project.  The complaint raises concerns about the legitimacy of the land acquisition and use process for the projects limestone quarrying operation close to the villages of Shella and Tynger in Meghalaya. The complainants further state that as Khasi indigenous people they have been deprived of their land, their livelihood has been impacted, and their customary land rights and systems have not been respected.  The complainants have requested confidentiality.   CAO Action CAO found the complaint eligible for further assessment in January 2014. During the assessment, CAO found no agreement among the key parties to proceed with a dispute resolution process under CAO auspices. Therefore, the complaint was transferred to CAOs Compliance function for appraisal, per CAO Operational Guidelines.   CAO completed its Compliance Appraisal in October 2014.  The Compliance Appraisal notes that the primary concerns of the complainants in this case relate to the companys acquisition of land that they claim to own.  While a just resolution of these issues is no doubt important for the parties, the information available is not found to support a conclusion that they raise substantial concerns about environmental and/or social outcomes of the project. CAO also notes the complainants concerns about the adequacy of IFCs engagement with the projects impacts on the indigenous people.  Absent a complaint from a broader group of project-affected people, however, CAO is reluctant to pursue an investigation on this basis. While Compliance Appraisal raises a number of questions about the strength of IFCs preparation and its supervision of E&S aspects of the project, these are not found to be of sufficient systemic importance to justify an investigation. On the balance of considerations, CAO thus decides to close the case.  Status CAO closed the case on October 14 , 2014. CAO's Appraisal Report and Assessment Report are available under 'View Documents' below.    Status as of October  17, 2014  Note: A CAO assessment does not entail a judgment on the merits of complaints.

IFC,CAO,21,2012,South Africa,Lonmin,"praisal In light of the reports of serious violence which resulted in the deaths of Lonmin workers and members of the South African police August 2012, the CAO Vice President triggered a compliance appraisal of IFCs investment in Lonmin plc. In particular how IFC reviewed, interacted and advised its client on matters related to work force, labor conflicts, labor unions, broader social impacts of unattended labor unrest/ latent conflict, and how IFC has assured itself of implementation of relevant IFC policy provisions. A CAO compliance appraisal is a preliminary investigation to determine whether the CAO should proceed to a full compliance investigation of IFC. Through such appraisals, CAO ensures that investigations of IFC/MIGA are initiated only for those cases that may raise substantial concerns regarding environmental and social outcomes.   Project Overview In December 2006 IFC approved an investment and advisory service project to support Lonmins multi-year expansion program at its platinum operations. The project consists of i) the development, expansion, and mechanization of Lonmins South African mines; ii) the financing of planned transactions regarding broader and more equitable ownership of South African businesses through Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) participation in Lonmins development programs; and (iii) through an IFC Advisory Service project, a comprehensive, large-scale community and Local Economic Development Program (LEDP) for the community of about 350,000 people living on and around Lonmins main operations.   CAO Findings CAOs appraisal report considered the adequacy of IFCs appraisal and supervision of its Lonmin investment. In particular it considered how IFC reviewed, interacted with and advised its client on matters related to labor conflict, and how IFC assured itself of implementation of relevant IFC policy provisions. Based on a review of documentation and interviews with IFC staff, the appraisal report raises concerns as to the adequacy of IFCs E&S performance in relation to this investment. It also identifies potentially more systemic issues regarding the way in which the Sustainability Framework was applied to an equity investment in a publically listed company.   Status  Absent a complaint from affected workers, however, CAO finds that the nexus between the E&S performance issues outlined in this appraisal and the tragic outcomes of the August 2012 dispute is insufficiently established. Therefore, CAO decides that an investigation is not warranted and closed the case.

IFC,CAO,21,2015,South Africa,Lonmin,"At the time of the complaint, IFC had an active Category A project with Lonmin Plc, a large platinum producer, for a multi-year expansion program of the companys operations. The project consisted of the development, expansion, and mechanization of Lonmins South African mines; and the development of a comprehensive, large-scale community and local economic development program (LEDP). IFCs investment in the project entailed a standby 10 year A loan of $100 million and an equity investment of $50 million. IFC completed its involvement in the project in January 2016.   In June 2015, CAO received a complaint from a local community organization and community members regarding Lonmins Marikana mine in North West Province, South Africa.  The complaint cites concerns about contamination of air and groundwater, and negative impacts on the living conditions of nearby communities, including on housing, water and sanitation, infrastructure and employment. The complaint also cites concerns about the projects social and environmental commitments, IFCs social and environmental due diligence, and non-compliance with national law.    CAO Action CAO found the complaint eligible for further assessment in June 2015 and an assessment trip was conducted in August 2015. During the assessment, the parties agreed to engage in a CAO convened dispute resolution process. CAO subsequently held a series of bilateral meetings with the parties during 2016 to provide capacity building and information, and assist them in drafting and adopting a set of principles to govern the dispute resolution process. CAO also convened several joint meetings as part of the mediation.  However, in December 2016 the complainants decided to withdraw from the process citing lack of progress, and this decision was confirmed in March 2017.  In accordance with CAOs Operational Guidelines, the case is being transferred to CAO's compliance function for appraisal.   In December 2017, CAO concluded its compliance appraisal. Considering the accounts of adverse impact provided by the complainants and the questions CAO identified in relation to IFCs review and supervision of the projects related aspects, CAO concludes that the complaint meets CAO's criteria for investigation.   Terms of reference for this compliance investigation were disclosed on January 16, 2018. A Xhosa version is available.
