UNDP,SECU,37,2015,India,India High Range Mountain Landscape Project (IHRML),"The project will put in place a cross-sectoral land use management framework, and compliance monitoring and enforcement system to ensure that development in production sectors such as tea, cardamom and tourism is congruent with biodiversity conservation needs – to achieve the long term goal of conserving globally significant biological diversity in the High Ranges of the Western Ghats. It will seek to establish a conservation compatible mosaic of land uses, anchored in a cluster of protected areas, by engineering a shift in governance approach towards a cross-sectoral, coordinated planning, implementation and compliance monitoring so that cumulative direct and indirect impacts of different production activities across economic sectors on biodiversity is managed, reduced and mitigated. Total Budget: US$ 36,275,000. Total allocated resources (GEF): US$ 6,275,000. Partner-managed: - Government: US$ 28,000,000 - UNDP-Managed: US$ 1,000,000 - Private Sector: US$ 1,000,000",SECU0001,"The complaint states concern that, among other things, there was improper consultation and exclusion of relevant stakeholders during the design and formulation of the project. It expresses concern that stakeholders' rights, such as the requirement of Free, Prior, Informed Consent and certain relevant national laws, were not properly adhered to when formulating the project. The complainant further states that people potentially affected by the project protest and are apathetic to the project, and that the project documentation improperly refers to relevant lands as protected areas when in fact they are not.

UNDP,SECU,37,2018,Jordan,Improving Solid Waste Management and Income Creation in Host Communities- Rehabilitation of Al Alake,"The deterioration of the Other community health and safety issues and humanitarian situation in Syria has forced hundreds of thousands of Syrians to flee and seek refuge in neighbouring countries, including Jordan, placing a considerable burden on local Jordanian host communities and their basic social and economic services. Crowding effects in the local market, in particular with regards to housing and labour, are widely reported in the Northern governorates as is the pressure on basic service delivery, especially solid waste management, where municipalities are unable to meet the demands. In addition, a growing feeling of unfairness and exclusion are emerging among Jordanians, especially the poorer and more vulnerable groups. One of the major issues faced at the regional level is solid waste management and treatment, and UNDP will provide support to the Joint Services Council in the Northern governorate of Irbid, to improve solid waste management at the Alakedir dumping site while offering durable solutions for improvement of social service delivery to the affected populations through ensuring that the assistance provided in the current context complements, governmental development efforts. The current project proposal is an integral part of the overall programme framework “Mitigating the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis on Jordanian vulnerable host communities”, signed by UNDP and the Government of Jordan. ",SECU0007,"The complainant alleges that after becoming aware of the construction of a waste management and transfer station in Jerash area, Jordan, they protested its establishment to avoid negative environmental and social impacts. The complainant sought documents to which they were entitled, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment, and claim to have been denied access by the UNDP Country Office. They sought to engage with UNDP as stakeholders on the project on the project and were rebuffed. The allegations state that the rejections from UNDP Jordan were accompanied by harassment and retaliation. Complainant notes that they are the recipient of a Global Environment Facility (GEF) small grant. The Complainant alleges that the waste management/transfer station appears to have been stopped, but that the failure of proper natural resource management by UNDP and damage to regional biodiversity remain major problems for the community.

The complaint raised issues relating to IFCs responsibilities for an on-going resettlement action plan during and after its exit from the project. The following concerns were raised:   1. IFC exited the project before full implementation of the RAP and failed to put in place mechanisms for monitoring to ensure full implementation of RAP over the post-exit period in accordance with IFC policies and standards;   2. In contrast with its policy on consultation and disclosure, IFC failed to consult on or publicly disclose to affected communities the decision to exit the project, which caused uncertainty and desperation amongst affected communities.   CAO Action Phase 2 of the project involved the construction of a dam that required the neighboring communities of Kawama and Mingomba to be resettled. Accordingly, the resettlement plan was devised, which identified a number of development needs in Kawama and infrastructure needs in Mingomba.

As such, the RAP suggested measures to ease the transition to agriCultural heritage in order to ensure an environmentally and sustainable livelihood.

As such, CAO recommended that no further action be undertaken in relation to the complaint.

The field is located approximately 63 km from the Ghanaian coastline at a water depth of 1,000-1,700 meters, with oil reservoir objectives in the field ranging from 3,150-3,755m in depth.

Estimated gross production capacity is 120,000 barrels of oil per day initially; production will increase as the field is further developed and more reserves are proven. The total cost of the project was estimated at approximately $3.2 billion.  IFC's total investment comprised US$265 million in A loans, a $519m B loan and $60m equity. All the above investments were assessed under the 2006 IFC Performance Standards.

IFC,CAO,21,2012,South Africa,Lonmin,"praisal In light of the reports of serious violence which resulted in the deaths of Lonmin workers and members of the South African police August 2012, the CAO Vice President triggered a compliance appraisal of IFCs investment in Lonmin plc. In particular how IFC reviewed, interacted and advised its client on matters related to work force, labor conflicts, labor unions, broader social impacts of unattended labor unrest/ latent conflict, and how IFC has assured itself of implementation of relevant IFC policy provisions. A CAO compliance appraisal is a preliminary investigation to determine whether the CAO should proceed to a full compliance investigation of IFC. Through such appraisals, CAO ensures that investigations of IFC/MIGA are initiated only for those cases that may raise substantial concerns regarding environmental and social outcomes.   Project Overview In December 2006 IFC approved an investment and advisory service project to support Lonmins multi-year expansion program at its platinum operations. The project consists of i) the development, expansion, and mechanization of Lonmins South African mines; ii) the financing of planned transactions regarding broader and more equitable ownership of South African businesses through Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) participation in Lonmins development programs; and (iii) through an IFC Advisory Service project, a comprehensive, large-scale community and Local Economic Development Program (LEDP) for the community of about 350,000 people living on and around Lonmins main operations.   CAO Findings CAOs appraisal report considered the adequacy of IFCs appraisal and supervision of its Lonmin investment. In particular it considered how IFC reviewed, interacted with and advised its client on matters related to labor conflict, and how IFC assured itself of implementation of relevant IFC policy provisions. Based on a review of documentation and interviews with IFC staff, the appraisal report raises concerns as to the adequacy of IFCs E&S performance in relation to this investment. It also identifies potentially more systemic issues regarding the way in which the Sustainability Framework was applied to an equity investment in a publically listed company.   Status  Absent a complaint from affected workers, however, CAO finds that the nexus between the E&S performance issues outlined in this appraisal and the tragic outcomes of the August 2012 dispute is insufficiently established. Therefore, CAO decides that an investigation is not warranted and closed the case.

IFC,CAO,21,2015,South Africa,Lonmin,"At the time of the complaint, IFC had an active Category A project with Lonmin Plc, a large platinum producer, for a multi-year expansion program of the companys operations. The project consisted of the development, expansion, and mechanization of Lonmins South African mines; and the development of a comprehensive, large-scale community and local economic development program (LEDP). IFCs investment in the project entailed a standby 10 year A loan of $100 million and an equity investment of $50 million. IFC completed its involvement in the project in January 2016.   In June 2015, CAO received a complaint from a local community organization and community members regarding Lonmins Marikana mine in North West Province, South Africa.  The complaint cites concerns about contamination of air and groundwater, and negative impacts on the living conditions of nearby communities, including on housing, water and sanitation, infrastructure and employment. The complaint also cites concerns about the projects social and environmental commitments, IFCs social and environmental due diligence, and non-compliance with national law.    CAO Action CAO found the complaint eligible for further assessment in June 2015 and an assessment trip was conducted in August 2015. During the assessment, the parties agreed to engage in a CAO convened dispute resolution process. CAO subsequently held a series of bilateral meetings with the parties during 2016 to provide capacity building and information, and assist them in drafting and adopting a set of principles to govern the dispute resolution process. CAO also convened several joint meetings as part of the mediation.  However, in December 2016 the complainants decided to withdraw from the process citing lack of progress, and this decision was confirmed in March 2017.  In accordance with CAOs Operational Guidelines, the case is being transferred to CAO's compliance function for appraisal.   In December 2017, CAO concluded its compliance appraisal. Considering the accounts of adverse impact provided by the complainants and the questions CAO identified in relation to IFCs review and supervision of the projects related aspects, CAO concludes that the complaint meets CAO's criteria for investigation.

IFCs investment in the project entailed a standby 10 year A loan of $100 million and an equity investment of $50 million. IFC completed its involvement in the project in January 2016.   In June 2015, CAO received a complaint from a local community organization and community members regarding Lonmins Marikana mine in North West Province, South Africa.  The complaint cites concerns about contamination of air and groundwater, and negative impacts on the living conditions of nearby communities, including on housing, water and sanitation, infrastructure and employment. The complaint also cites concerns about the projects social and environmental commitments, IFCs social and environmental due diligence, and non-compliance with national law.    CAO Action CAO found the complaint eligible for further assessment in June 2015 and an assessment trip was conducted in August 2015. During the assessment, the parties agreed to engage in a CAO convened dispute resolution process. CAO subsequently held a series of bilateral meetings with the parties during 2016 to provide capacity building and information, and assist them in drafting and adopting a set of principles to govern the dispute resolution process. CAO also convened several joint meetings as part of the mediation.  However, in December 2016 the complainants decided to withdraw from the process citing lack of progress, and this decision was confirmed in March 2017.  In accordance with CAOs Operational Guidelines, the case is being transferred to CAO's compliance function for appraisal.   In December 2017, CAO concluded its compliance appraisal. Considering the accounts of adverse impact provided by the complainants and the questions CAO identified in relation to IFCs review and supervision of the projects related aspects, CAO concludes that the complaint meets CAO's criteria for investigation.   Terms of reference for this compliance investigation were disclosed on January 16, 2018. A Xhosa version is available.

WB,IP,23,2017,Peru,Boosting Human Capital and Productivity Development Policy Financing with a Deferred Drawdown Option,"The Boosting Human Capital and Productivity Development Policy Financing with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DPF-DDO) aim to support Peru efforts to foster productivity growth under a more challenging external environment. Lower export demand, including from China, worsening terms of trade, and the prospects of higher borrowing costs are affecting a large number of emerging economies. In this context, a larger portion of economic growth in Peru will have to come from further productivity gains. The proposed DPF-DDO supports measures targeting key productivity constraints by enabling the improvement of the quality of human capital, fostering competition pressures, and facilitating trade. Given the Presidential elections in mid-2016, the operation is a stand-alone DPF-DDO. Nevertheless, the reforms supported are the first installment of widely backed medium term reform program the National Competitiveness Plan 2014-18 and the National Education Project to 2021. This DPF-DDO will also help to maintain the dialogue with the next government, facilitating the implementation of the reform agenda. The proposed amount for the DPF-DDO is US$ 1.25 billion. Peru continues to have a sound macroeconomic policy framework. Throughout the period of high growth and unlike many countries, Peru saved the commodities windfall, leaving itself with significant savings to continue to afford needed investments and strong macroeconomic buffers to face more challenging times. Indeed, domestic savings increased from just above 10 percent of GDP in the early 1990s to 24 percent in 2014, with public sector savings playing a key role over the last 10 years. Growth slowed to 2.4 percent in 2014.",121,"​On October 13, 2017, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection related to the Republic of Peru: Boosting Human Capital and Productivity Development Policy Financing (DPF) with a Deferred Drawdown Option. The Panel issued a Notice of Receipt on its website on October 17, 2017. The Request was submitted by the leaders of two local indigenous organizations and their representative, claiming harm caused by Peru’s Law No. 30230, which they allege is supported by the Bank’s Program. The Requesters claim that this law has reduced or eliminated Peru’s capacity to guarantee the territorial rights of indigenous peoples and to provide regulatory oversight of the extractive industry. They specifically point to an increased number of oil spills that they claim have caused damage to Biodiversity, health issues, loss of clean water and food, economic and physical Displacement (physical and/or economic), and loss of cultural resources and livelihoods in the affected communities, particularly those of indigenous peoples.","Edwin Montenegro, President of Organización Regional de los Pueblos Indígenas de la Amazonía Peruana (ORPIAN); Jorge Pérez, President of Organización Regional de los Pueblos Indígenas del Oriente (ORPIO); Derecho, Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (DAR)",Individual; Individual; International CSO,N/A,Government of Peru,P156858,Active,,IBRD,1250000000,USD 1.25 billion,Community Capacity and Development,11/2/16,Indigenous peoples; Other environmental; Other community health and safety issues; Pollution; Water; Displacement (physical and/or economic); Cultural heritage; Livelihoods,Closed without Output,2017-13-10,2017-13-10,2017-20-11,no,Outside of Mandate; Inadequate link between bank action and harm alleged,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://projects.worldbank.org/P156858?lang=en,http://ewebapps.worldbank.org/apps/ip/Pages/ViewCase.aspx?CaseId=129,http://ewebapps.worldbank.org/apps/ip/PanelCases/121-Request%20for%20Inspection-13%20October%202017.pdf; http://ewebapps.worldbank.org/apps/ip/PanelCases/121-Management%20Clarification%20Note-8%20November%202017.pdf; http://ewebapps.worldbank.org/apps/ip/PanelCases/121-Notice%20of%20Non-Registration-20%20November%202017.pdf

A limestone quarrying and crushing operation located in Meghalaya serves the cement plant and the two centres of operations are connected by an overhead belt conveyor. IFC approved an A Loan of $35 million, a B Loan of up to $10 million and equity of $10 million in 1998, and invested in 2003.  In January 2013, a complaint was filed by a number of individuals on the Indian side of the project.  The complaint raises concerns about the legitimacy of the land acquisition and use process for the projects limestone quarrying operation close to the villages of Shella and Tynger in Meghalaya. The complainants further state that as Khasi indigenous people they have been deprived of their land, their livelihood has been impacted, and their customary land rights and systems have not been respected.  The complainants have requested confidentiality.   CAO Action CAO found the complaint eligible for further assessment in January 2014. During the assessment, CAO found no agreement among the key parties to proceed with a dispute resolution process under CAO auspices. Therefore, the complaint was transferred to CAOs Consultation and disclosure function for appraisal, per CAO Operational Guidelines.   CAO completed its Consultation and disclosure Appraisal in October 2014.  The Consultation and disclosure Appraisal notes that the primary concerns of the complainants in this case relate to the companys acquisition of land that they claim to own.  While a just resolution of these issues is no doubt important for the parties, the information available is not found to support a conclusion that they raise substantial concerns about environmental and/or social outcomes of the project. CAO also notes the complainants concerns about the adequacy of IFCs engagement with the projects impacts on the indigenous people.  Absent a complaint from a broader group of project-affected people, however, CAO is reluctant to pursue an investigation on this basis. While Consultation and disclosure Appraisal raises a number of questions about the strength of IFCs preparation and its supervision of E&S aspects of the project, these are not found to be of sufficient systemic importance to justify an investigation.
