<p>
The Request was submitted by an international NGO, Afrique-Europe Interact, with local
representation in Mali. The NGO complained about land grabbing by the project and its adverse
effects on the people living in the villages of Sanamadougou and Sahou. The inhabitants of these villages, who refused to leave their agricultural lands at the beginning of the project, have allegedly been subjected to serious violations of their rights and have received threats to their physical security. In addition, a number of those affected by the project (i.e. PAPs), were not compensated while a few others received only symbolic compensation amounts for their lands and properties. The Director of the Compliance Review and Mediation Unit (CRMU) registered the Request on 12 May, 2016 pending verification of two issues: (a) if there was any land dispute case pending
before any courts in Mali at the time of submission of the Request, and (b) if the NGO, being a
foreign representative, had obtained representational authority to act on behalf of the people affected by the project.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The project will expand M3’s existing processing facilities to produce: (i) semolina from durum
wheat, millet and maize; (ii) long and short pasta, as well as couscous from wheat, millet and
maize; and (iii) flour from kibbled millet and maize. M3 will also acquire a new flour mill for the
production of bread-quality wheat flour or “flour mill”. The production residue will be used to
produce animal feed.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The M3 is located approximately 230 km from Bamako, in the Rural Commune of Sébougou
which is almost part of the city of Ségou. It is located on a plot involving eight contiguous land
titles (TF No. 1133-1140 ) with a total area of 7 ha 15 a 38 ca. The town is under the supervision
of the Sous-Prefect of Ségou. The project’s influence extends to the rural communes of Sébougou
and Ségou and their surroundings. Seven production chains will be set up on the M3 Project site
at Ségou. The project is expected to promote local agricultural development and to strengthen the
value chains by creating direct and indirect employment as well as business opportunities for local
entrepreneurs. By producing import substitutes, the project is expected to have a positive impact
on the trade balance, while the increased local production will enhance food security by creating
jobs and wealth for the country. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The project involves the installation of units for the production of couscous and pasta. These
include silos for the storage of raw materials (hard wheat, soft wheat, maize, millet and sorghum),
and three (03) mills for the production of meal and flour to be used to supply production lines.
Other facilities associated with the project include; boilers (steam and hot water), air compressors
(compressed air production), refrigerators (cooling water production), and electric transformers. 
Under the project, silos will be acquired, allowing for an increase in M3 storage capacity to 20,000
tons for durum wheat, 5,000 tons for maize, and 5,000 tons for millet.

The project is a €200 million loan to Public Enterprise Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS),
guaranteed by the Republic of Serbia, and subject to the Bank’s policy requirements for
public sector projects. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The loan proceeds will be used to restructure EPS’s balance sheet, replacing short and
medium term financial debt entered into on an emergency basis to alleviate a critical cash
situation created by the unprecedented and catastrophic floods in Serbia in 2014. EBRD’s
operation provides long term debt with terms better matched to the underlying assets and
EPS’s operations. The refinancing will free up resources to allow the EPS to focus on the
implementation of its long term capital expenditure program, which involves substantial
modernisation of Serbia’s power sector infrastructure.
</p>
<br>
<p>
This Project will also allow EBRD to continue its engagement with EPS on environmental and
social issues.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In this new Project, following the EBRD’s due diligence carried out with the assistance of TCfunded
independent consultant, a new, updated Company-wide ESAP was agreed that
provides a comprehensive response to environmental and social issues associated with
EPS’s operations. EPS is committed to enhancing its environmental and social management
systems for the restructured Company in line with good international practice and will be
revising its corporate environmental and social strategy accordingly. The strategy will be
based on an outline prepared by the consultants, which includes a new Resettlement
Framework. The ESAP also reinforces the commitment to implement the action plans from
the company-wide EHS audits. These further actions address a number of the
recommendations of the PCM Compliance Review on the Kolubara Environmental
Improvement Project. A post-signing TC provided a consultant to survey EPS for corporate
governance gaps and to provide an action plan to remedy them.

We have assisted communities to raise complaints about large-scale mining ventures affecting their water resources and endangering their livelihoods, specifically the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine (“OT Project”) and the Ukhaa Khudag coal mine.</p>
<br>
<p>The OT Project has faced fierce community resistance in Mongolia for years.  One of the biggest concerns is the amount of water, a scarce and valuable resource in the South Gobi desert, that the Project will require.  Traditional nomadic herders, who have lived in the region for centuries, have already experienced problems with wells going dry.  Additionally, the infrastructure and construction related to the Project is degrading and fragmenting herders’ traditional pastures, forcing some of them to abandon their herding lifestyles.  Several herders have already experienced devastating herd loss and other impacts after being forced to resettle because of the OT Project. Furthermore, herders complaint that the company forced them to sign unfair contracts in violation of their rights.  They have found the company largely unresponsive to their concerns.</p>
<br>
<p>The $13.2 billion OT Project, operated by Rio Tinto, is the largest foreign investment in Mongolia.  Despite the OT Project’s numerous problems, the project is supported by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation (“IFC”) and Multilateral Insurance Guarantee Agency (“MIGA”), as well as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (“EBRD”). The Netherlands Development Finance Company (“FMO”), U.S. Export-Import Bank, Export Development Canada and the Australian Export Finance and Insurance Corporation have also committed financing for the project.</p>
<br>
<p>Accountability Counsel has supported two complaints to the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, the accountability office for the IFC and MIGA, raising concerns about the OT Project’s impacts on local water resources and about the adequacy of resettlement and compensation packages. The CAO has convened a dialogue process to assist the herders to reach an agreement with the project company on these issues. The dialogue process is ongoing and has resulted in the establishment of a Tripartite Council, with herder representatives meeting with local government and company representatives on a monthly bases to work towards resolution of the CAO complaints and future community grievances related to the project.</p>
<br>
<p>The Ukhaa Khudag coal mine is located on a section of the world’s largest untapped coking coal and thermal coal deposits, the Tavan Tolgoi. The mine is operated by a Mongolian company, Energy Resources LLC, and is commonly referred to as the “Energy Resources Mine.” Most of its coal product is shipped over land to the Chinese boarder, which has led to the gradual development of a sprawling web of mining roads, ranging from paved roads to informal dirt roads intersecting each other and multiplying by the day. These roads and other project infrastructure have led to severe fragmentation of herders’ pastures, excessive dust and unsafe road conditions which in turn have resulted in fatal traffic accidents and other concerns over herder and animal health. The Energy Resources Mine has received financing from the EBRD.</p>
<br>
<p>In 2013, local herders filed a series of complaints to the EBRD’s Project Complaint Mechanism (“PCM”) raising concerns about pasture fragmentation, dust, and other impacts from the growing network of roads and infrastructure associated with both the OT Project and Energy Resources Mine. Accountability Counsel has supported herders throughout the complaint process and a compliance audit is currently underway to investigate allegations of EBRD policy violations.</p>",FALSE,FALSE,7/2/13,7/2/13,8/2/13,closed_with_outcome,,8/2/13,12/22/14,closed_with_outcome,,,,not_undertaken,Not offered by mechanism,12/22/14,,in_progress,,,,,,,81.2,72.93564458,22.23737365,8.205257602,,4385.379355,53.70899963,66.2009964,,150.0536578,1.846795103,31.903,1564120,

The project will support the urban development of three medium-sized cities in the southwestern part of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) Fangchenggang City, Chongzuo City, and Baise City. All the project cities are surrounded by counties with widespread poverty. The project will have six investment components in the project cities and one capacity development component. The investment components in each project city will be part of an overall city development program guided by a well prepared city development master plan. The capacity development component is designed to complement the infrastructure development to be funded under the project. It is part of the national poverty reduction strategy to promote inclusive growth in the less-developed western PRC. The project has adopted a holistic approach to building urban roads and underground municipal infrastructure in a coherent and integrated manner. Construction of urban infrastructure is supported with capacity development and environmental improvement components, including activities to strengthen climate change resilience of coastal and inland urban areas. The complaint pertains to the Fangchenggang component of this project. Based on immediately available project documents, this component will include the construction of a (i) 17.285 km road network; (ii) ii) Main and secondary sewer and drainage system in the Gongche Industrial Park; and (iii) Anfujiang Bridge with total length of 240 m. Some construction works in Fangchenggang were delayed due to relocation issues but a special review mission by ADB (PRCM) from 28 November to 2 December 2016 settled the major land acquisition and resettlement issue thereby resulting to the resumption of works.

<p>
On 18 December 2014, the Bank approved the Road and Transport Facilitation Programme
within the Mano River Union (MRU). The Governments of Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and
Sierra Leone submitted a request to the Bank for financing to develop and asphalt the Danané-
Lola road (87.35 km), the Bloléquin-Toulépleu-Liberian border road (65 km), the Tablo-Prollo
road (28 km), the Karloken-Fish Town (80 km) and the Harper-Cavally junction (16 km).
These constitute 276.35 km of currently dirt roads, barely 6 m wide, impassable in all seasons,
with makeshift wooden crossing structures, for the most part. Regional isolation, the high
number of roadside checks and unsuitable border crossings are factors of fragility which
compound the successive crises that have affected the region over the last 20 years. However,
traffic is set to grow on these roads given the economic potential of the area and the efforts to
lift these countries out of the recurrent crises that have long characterised them. In order to
cope with current and future traffic, it is imperative to improve the road service level, enhance
their capacity to withstand traffic in all seasons and reduce border controls; this will require
asphalting and developing the roads and establishing border crossings for joint controls. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The overall objective of the programme is to boost post-conflict economic recovery of the
MRU area by improving road infrastructure and promoting intra-community trade.
Specifically, the programme seeks to: (i) improve transport conditions on the roads concerned
in order to reduce transport costs, (ii) facilitate the free movement of persons and goods
between the three countries, namely Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea and Liberia and improve the living
conditions of programme area communities.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The Guinean component of the programme includes, among other things, paving of the LolaIvorian
border road (39.75 km).

We have assisted communities to raise complaints about large-scale mining ventures affecting their water resources and endangering their livelihoods, specifically the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine (“OT Project”) and the Ukhaa Khudag coal mine.</p>

<p>The OT Project has faced fierce community resistance in Mongolia for years.  One of the biggest concerns is the amount of water, a scarce and valuable resource in the South Gobi desert, that the Project will require.  Traditional nomadic herders, who have lived in the region for centuries, have already experienced problems with wells going dry.  Additionally, the infrastructure and construction related to the Project is degrading and fragmenting herders’ traditional pastures, forcing some of them to abandon their herding lifestyles.  Several herders have already experienced devastating herd loss and other impacts after being forced to resettle because of the OT Project. Furthermore, herders complaint that the company forced them to sign unfair contracts in violation of their rights.  They have found the company largely unresponsive to their concerns.</p>

<p>The $13.2 billion OT Project, operated by Rio Tinto, is the largest foreign investment in Mongolia.  Despite the OT Project’s numerous problems, the project is supported by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation (“IFC”) and Multilateral Insurance Guarantee Agency (“MIGA”), as well as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (“EBRD”). The Netherlands Development Finance Company (“FMO”), U.S. Export-Import Bank, Export Development Canada and the Australian Export Finance and Insurance Corporation have also committed financing for the project.</p>

<p>Accountability Counsel has supported two complaints to the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, the accountability office for the IFC and MIGA, raising concerns about the OT Project’s impacts on local water resources and about the adequacy of resettlement and compensation packages. The CAO has convened a dialogue process to assist the herders to reach an agreement with the project company on these issues. The dialogue process is ongoing and has resulted in the establishment of a Tripartite Council, with herder representatives meeting with local government and company representatives on a monthly bases to work towards resolution of the CAO complaints and future community grievances related to the project.</p>

<p>The Ukhaa Khudag coal mine is located on a section of the world’s largest untapped coking coal and thermal coal deposits, the Tavan Tolgoi. The mine is operated by a Mongolian company, Energy Resources LLC, and is commonly referred to as the “Energy Resources Mine.” Most of its coal product is shipped over land to the Chinese boarder, which has led to the gradual development of a sprawling web of mining roads, ranging from paved roads to informal dirt roads intersecting each other and multiplying by the day. These roads and other project infrastructure have led to severe fragmentation of herders’ pastures, excessive dust and unsafe road conditions which in turn have resulted in fatal traffic accidents and other concerns over herder and animal health. The Energy Resources Mine has received financing from the EBRD.</p>

<p>In 2013, local herders filed a series of complaints to the EBRD’s Project Complaint Mechanism (“PCM”) raising concerns about pasture fragmentation, dust, and other impacts from the growing network of roads and infrastructure associated with both the OT Project and Energy Resources Mine. Accountability Counsel has supported herders throughout the complaint process and a compliance audit is currently underway to investigate allegations of EBRD policy violations.</p>",FALSE,FALSE,2/11/13,,,not_undertaken,,2/11/13,2/1/13,closed_with_outcome,,7/1/13,5/1/17,closed_with_outcome,,,,not_undertaken,,5/1/17,,in_progress,,6/30/14,81.2,72.93564458,22.23737365,8.205257602,,4385.379355,53.70899963,66.2009964,,150.0536578,1.846795103,31.903,1564120,

Productive Infrastructure Program - Request II,Productive Infrastructure Program,Haiti,IDB Independent Consultation and Investigation Mechanism,Inter-American Development Bank,MICI-BID-HA-2017-0114,Active,,Project/investment lending,"Infrastructure, Manufacturing","Displacement (physical and/or economic), Human rights, Livelihoods, Other environmental","The Request alleges the loss of the forms of subsistence of the requesting families, as a result of having been displaced from their lands in January of 2011 for the development of the Caracol Industrial Park (the Project) in the area located within close proximity to the Caracol Bay, which assists in the exportation objectives of the Park.

The Requesters, principally dedicated toward agricultural activities for their food security and economic sustenance, were land owners in the area selected for the Project. The Requesters allege that their displacement from the land had been carried out with minimal days’ notice, without consultation with the communities, and without information having been provided in this regard.

In addition, the Requesters signal that the compensation offered would have been received several years later, and that it would have been inadequate to ensure the quality of life of the requesting families. This, in turn, would have led to poorer living conditions, in comparison to the conditions existent prior to the displacement, due to the resulting situation that would not allow the Requesters to cover their cost of living. Furthermore, the Request alleges that some families have not, to date, received compensation, after six years of the displacement having taken place.

The Request also raises the issue of harm to the requesting families due to the lack of information regarding the environmental impacts on the Caracol Bay zone and the Troud-du North River, as a result of the construction and operation of the Park; such is also the case with respect to the social impacts experienced by the surrounding communities due to the introduction of the Project. Finally, the Request also presents information about the possible violations of labor codes in relation to the personnel that currently works in the Park.",FALSE,FALSE,1/12/17,1/12/17,1/23/17,closed_with_outcome,,1/23/17,2/22/17,closed_with_outcome,,6/14/17,,in_progress,,,,not_undertaken,,,,not_undertaken,,,,,,,,765.6839246,63.82799911,72.63400269,,,398.4480769,45.654,27750,0.353092294

The loans are part of Tranche 2 of a multi-tranche financing facility whose target outcome is the achievement of a cleaner electricity mix with more efficient and effective generation and transmission system in Rajasthan. Funding under Tranche 2 is comprised of two loans with $238 million (i.e., Loan 3482) from ADB’s Ordinary Capital Resources and $110 million (i.e., Loan 8312) from the Clean Technology Fund (an external fund administered by ADB). Tranche 2 was approved by ADB on 5 December 2016. The loans have not been signed yet and are not yet effective. Tranche 2 will finance investments in (i) construction of 210 km of 765kV transmission line, 264 km of 400kV transmission line, 240 km of 220kV double circuit transmission line, 132 km of 132kV transmission line, and Optical Ground Wires (OPGW) to connect existing substations; and (ii) construction of eight substations, augmentation of transformers at two substations, and bay extensions at five substations. CO2 reduction of 8,578,704 tons per annum is an indirect benefit of this project, which will be achieved by transmitting renewable energy to be generated from Western Rajasthan.

The Sendou Coal-Fired Power Plant Project was approved on 25 November 2009 by the Board
of Directors as a senior loan of 55 million euros in favor of Compagnie d’Electrictie du Senegal
(CES) to develop and maintain a 125 MW coal-fired power plant located 35 km from Dakar in
Sendou, Senegal. In addition, the AfDB approved a supplementary loan of Euros 5 million and
had disbursed 55 million euros as of 8 March 2017. The total cost of the Project is Euro 206
million. The Bank co-finances this amount with the Banque Ouest Africaine de Développement
(BOAD) and the Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V.
(FMO). The project is being developed on a “build, own, and operate” basis and targets to supply
up to 40% of Senegal’s electricity, which currently derives 80% of its electricity from diesel-fueled power generation. The Government of Senegal (GOS) has outlined a strategy for diversifying and
increasing domestic power generation capacity with a combination of conventional thermal base
load and renewable energy. It is the first coal-fired plant in Senegal. The coal will be imported via
sea and unloaded at Dakar harbor from where it will be transported by trucks to the coal storage
site on the plant. The project aims at producing at least 925 GWh of electricity a year. The power
will be delivered to the national interconnected grid system of SENELEC, Senegal’s public
electricity utility company. The project includes the development, design, procurement,
construction, operation and maintenance of a 125 MW coal-fired power plant on a 22 hectare-site.
Power production can be expanded to 250 MW through a second phase project, for which project
preparation have not yet started. The project will also build a 1.6 km 225 kV transmission line and
associated switchyard to connect the plant to SENELEC. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The project is located about 600 meters away from the Atlantic Ocean and near two
communities, the town of Bargny located at 2 km north-west and a fishing village, Minam, with
600 inhabitants to the south. The project is located 500 meters from dwellings, a school, a
watercourse, a lake and a water collection point and areas designated for residential developments.
A 500 meter buffer zone around the plant is required by Senegalese law. Active on the grounds of
the power plant is a substantial group of women who regularly – since many generations – dry fish
on the ground which they receive from fishermen at the Bargny harbor. These activities require
space as fish is laid out on the ground for drying. Between 1000 and 4000 women pursue this
activity for about 9 months during the year. Dried fish is then sold to male workers who package
the dried fish and transport it to markets in Dakar and to the harbor for export.

The Project Company is Compagnie d’Electricite du Snegal SA (CES), whose original sponsor
was Nykomb Synergetics of Sweden. Late in 2012, AFG, an investment bank of Morocco joined
as equity partner. In October 2015, Quantum Power acquired the equity interest of AFG and
became joint equity sponsor with Nykomb. The construction of the power plant has been
contracted out to two Indian companies: Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHIEL) and Promac
Engineering Industries Ltd (Promac). The new Project Sponsor, Quantum Power, took necessary
measures to relaunch the construction of the power plant, and to secure additional equity needed
to complete the Project. Construction resumed in January 2016 and the Project is now scheduled
to begin commercial operation by end of 2017.

The Project is part of an overall investment program valued at $1.1 billion to be
implemented from 2010-2020 which aims to improve the reach, quality, and continuity of urban
transport in Georgia. To partially fund it, a multi-tranche financing facility (MFF) with a maximum
financing amount of $300 million was approved by ADB in July 2010. Said MFF which is to be
implemented from 2010 to 2018, is for the (i) extension, rehabilitation, and improvement of
urban transport infrastructure in Anaklia, Batumi, Kutaisi, Poti, Rustavi, and Tbilisi; (ii) increased
institutional effectiveness, including the reorganization and reforms at the Tbilisi municipality,
other municipalities and urban transport service providers; and (iii) establishment of program
management team with a capability and funds to handle project preparation, technical design,
contract bidding, evaluation and award, contract supervision, progress monitoring and
reporting.  Investments funded under the MFF will improve the transport system and
infrastructure in urban areas. They include two subprojects: (i) section 2 (km 4.0-10.8) of the
international standard Tbilisi-Rustavi Urban Road Link; and (ii) phase 2 of Anaklia Coastal
Improvement. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The Project is funded under Tranche 3 of the MFF, which was approved on 25
November 2013. The total project cost is $118.2 million and ADB funds $73 million under this
tranche. The borrower is the Government of Georgia and the Municipal Development Fund
(MDF) of Georgia is the executing agency. The Project, which is implemented from ADB
Headquarters by the Urban Development and Water Division of the Central and West Asia
Department, is categorized as B for environmental impacts; A for involuntary resettlement
impacts; C for indigenous peoples’ impacts. Construction work under the project has not yet,
started. Procurement of the civil works contract is ongoing. Commencement of the works is not
anticipated before August 2016. A draft initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Project
was completed and posted on the ADB website in September 2013. This initial IEE was revised
as vibration and noise impacts needed to be studied. A revised IEE was posted on the ADB
website in December 2015. The construction of Section 2 of 6.8 km will involve acquisition of
312 land plots with 29.5 hectares of land areas, demolition of 692 structures (82 residential
structures, 90 industrial and commercial structures, and 520 minor structures). A total of 282
households and 33 businesses will be affected. Per ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS),3
 a
land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) was prepared prior to the approval of the
MFF. Subsequently the land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) was prepared. It is
presently under implementation. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The complaint refers to subproject 1: Tbilisi-Rustavi Urban Road Link (section 2) of the
Project which involves the modernization of an existing and construction of a new road from
Phonichala to Rustavi. When finished, the total road length for this Project will be 6.8 km, of
which 3.8 km is new road construction along the Mktvari river. Once completed, it is expected
that the road will be of international standard, Category I highway, with 4 to 6 lanes and with a
general design that can accommodate vehicles with speed of 120km/h. In some areas, a
reduction of speed is anticipated to mitigate noise impacts.
